## Overview
This project demonstrates the interpretation of a machine learning model using Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). The model predicts customer churn based on various features using a Random Forest Classifier.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from the file 'Churn_Modelling.csv', which includes information about bank customers.
